The **ClickStore** is an online content store where [Clickteam Fusion 2.5] users
and visitors can buy and download various resources for their projects. Users
can also register as a seller and upload their own content for the store. Users
determine their price and will receive 70% of the sale with 30% going to [Clickteam](/clickteam/),
who take care of the listings, delivery, payments, processing and fees. The
objective of the store is to provide a central hub for clickers and an opportunity
for users to show off their content.

Not to be confused with **[Clickteam's Shop](/clickteam/shop/)** for purchasing products and exporters.

Content that is submitted to the store is decided by a small team whether it
violates the agreement and whether it meets the functionality or asset as described.

### Refunds
Refunds are handled by Clickteam's agents, however some works such as art and
music are non-refundable under any situation.

Anyone can register for a Seller Account and sell their creations on the store.

is specified, the distributor agreement is active. Sellers may only withdraw
their earnings once they reach at least $50.
