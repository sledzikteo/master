### No Cookies
ClickWiki does not use any analytics service for the intent of gathering
anonymous or technical details about your visit. This was previously the
case prior to **May 20th 2018**, however this data has been disposed under
the new GDPR European law and migration to being a static site.

### Personal Data
When writing for the wiki, we only expect reasonable identifable information
to be present on the wiki. For instance, data that identifies a developer in
the community where this data is considered publicly accessible is acceptable,
but data that may be harmful or private to an individual would violate our
privacy stance.

Making contributions using Git leaves a permanent mark in this project's
history. Standard Git operations means that your e-mail address and full name
(for instance) will be exposed to the public and stored outside of your control.
For example, where users have downloaded copies of the source code to their
local computer and/or forked the repository online.

Commit data is fetched via the public GitHub API for the purposes of populating
the [Recent] page. This has a limit of 60 requests per hour based on your IP
address.
