A community Wiki-based website for [Clickteam](https://clickteam.com). This repository contains the
code and content delivering the wiki, powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

The wiki aims to:

* Deliver facts, history and some documentation to Clickteam's products.
* Collate notable examples and user creations.
* Archive the growing number of extensions and features.

All contributions come from the community of clickers. If you spot something missing, we'd greatly appreciate your input.


# Moved from MediaWiki
Previously, we've been using [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki) to host the Wiki as a service. Our instance
has been getting a little rusty by being prone to cache issues. It also has the maintainance hurdle with the database,
software versions and protecting user information.

We've migrated to become a static site to reduce costs, boost speed, improve security (no more database) and flexibility.

To preview the changes on your computer, you'll need to [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) or push to your
fork to preview on GitHub Pages.

Our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ClickWiki/clickwiki.github.io/issues) keeps track of website problems (both cosmetic and functional)
as well as content issues.
